While the game seems to share some things in common with our game, when it comes to building in Empires and Tribes you build it yourself in third-person as opposed to our game where its in first-person and in delegation and when it comes to exploration we want our game to have much more of it as opposed to empires and tribes.




#2. Sapiens
